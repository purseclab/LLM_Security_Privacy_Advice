1,"Under GDPR, controllers do not need data processing agreements with processors because the GDPR imposes direct obligations on processors","The claim that ""Under GDPR, controllers do not need data processing agreements with processors because the GDPR imposes direct obligations on processors"" is not true.

Article 28 of the GDPR requires that controllers use only processors that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. This means that controllers must have a written contract with their processors that sets out the obligations of the processor, such as the processor's duty to comply with the GDPR, to protect personal data, and to notify the controller of any data breaches.

While the GDPR does impose direct obligations on processors, these obligations are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the GDPR. Controllers must still enter into a written contract with their processors to ensure that their processors are aware of their obligations and that they are able to meet those obligations.

Here are some of the benefits of having a DPA in place:

It can help to ensure that the processor complies with the GDPR.
It can help to protect the controller from liability in the event of a data breach.
It can provide legal certainty for both the controller and the processor.
If you are a controller, it is important to have a DPA in place with any processors that you use. This will help to ensure that you are in compliance with the GDPR and that you are protected from liability in the event of a data breach.

2,"Under GDPR, when relying on consent to process personal data, consent must be explicit","Yes, it is true. Article 7 of the GDPR states that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"". This means that the data subject must be able to understand what they are consenting to, and they must be able to do so without any pressure or coercion.

Explicit consent is one way to ensure that consent is freely given. Explicit consent means that the data subject must actively agree to the processing of their personal data. This can be done by ticking a box, signing a form, or making a verbal statement.

There are some situations where explicit consent is not required. For example, consent is not required if the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, or if the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person.

However, in most cases, businesses will need to obtain explicit consent from data subjects before processing their personal data. This is because explicit consent provides the highest level of protection for data subjects.

Here are some tips for obtaining explicit consent:

Make sure that the consent is clear and easy to understand.
Use plain language and avoid jargon.
Explain the purpose of the processing and how the data will be used.
Make sure that the consent is freely given and not coerced.
Give the data subject the opportunity to withdraw their consent at any time.
By following these tips, you can help to ensure that you are complying with the GDPR's consent requirements.",Support
3,"Under GDPR, everyone needs a data protection officer","No, it is not true that everyone needs a data protection officer (DPO) under GDPR. The GDPR requires organizations to appoint a DPO if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

They are a public authority or body.
They process large amounts of sensitive personal data.
They carry out systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale.
For organizations that do not meet these criteria, appointing a DPO is not mandatory, but it is still strongly recommended. A DPO can provide valuable assistance in ensuring compliance with the GDPR, and can help to protect the organization from data breaches and other privacy violations.

If you are unsure whether or not your organization needs to appoint a DPO, you should consult with a data protection lawyer or other qualified professional.",Negate
4,The GDPR will only affect organisations in Europe,"The claim that ""The GDPR will only affect organisations in Europe"" is not true. The GDPR is a regulation in the European Union that sets rules for the processing of personal data by organizations, regardless of where they are located. This means that any organization that processes personal data of EU citizens or residents, even if the organization is located outside of the EU, must comply with the GDPR.

The GDPR applies to a wide range of organizations, including businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations. It covers all aspects of the processing of personal data, from collection to storage to deletion. The GDPR also gives individuals a number of rights with respect to their personal data, including the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict the processing of their data.

Organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR can face significant fines. The maximum fine for a single violation is ???20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is greater.

The GDPR is a complex regulation, and organizations that need to comply with it should seek professional advice. However, the GDPR is an important step in protecting the privacy of individuals in the European Union.",Negate
5,"Under GDPR, controllers and processors will only have to answer to a single data protection authority","This claim is not entirely true. Under the GDPR, controllers and processors are still subject to the laws of the countries in which they operate. However, the GDPR does provide for a one-stop shop for cross-border data transfers. This means that if a controller or processor is based in one country and processes data in another, they can only be subject to the data protection authority (DPA) in the country where they are based. This can make it easier for controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR, as they do not have to deal with multiple DPAs.

However, there are some exceptions to the one-stop shop. For example, if a controller or processor is subject to a specific legal requirement in the country where the data is processed, they may still be subject to the DPA in that country. Additionally, if a data subject makes a complaint to a DPA in another country, that DPA may still investigate the complaint.

Overall, the one-stop shop is a significant improvement over the previous data protection regime. It makes it easier for controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR and it gives data subjects more protection.",Negate
6,Biometric data are sensitive data under the GDPR,"Yes, it is true. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that outlines the rights of individuals with regards to their personal data and the obligations of organizations that process personal data. Under the GDPR, biometric data is considered a ""special category of personal data"". This means that it is subject to additional protections than other types of personal data.

Biometric data is any data that is derived from a person's physical or behavioral characteristics and can be used to uniquely identify that person. Examples of biometric data include fingerprints, facial scans, and voice recordings.

The GDPR considers biometric data to be sensitive because it can be used to discriminate against individuals or to track their movements or activities. For example, an employer could use biometric data to track the attendance of its employees, or a government could use it to track the movements of its citizens.

The GDPR places a number of restrictions on the processing of biometric data. Organizations that process biometric data must have a legal basis for doing so, such as consent from the individual or a legitimate interest. They must also take steps to protect the biometric data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

Organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR's requirements for processing biometric data could face fines of up to ???20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover, whichever is greater.",Support
7,"Under GDPR, individuals have an absolute right to be forgotten","The claim that ""Under GDPR, individuals have an absolute right to be forgotten"" is not entirely true. The GDPR does give individuals the right to have their personal data erased, but this right is not absolute. There are a number of exceptions to the right to be forgotten, such as where the data is necessary for the performance of a public task or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

In addition, the right to be forgotten is not a right to have all traces of an individual's personal data erased from the internet. It is only a right to have the data erased from the control of the data controller. This means that the data may still be available online, but it will not be accessible by the data controller.

The right to be forgotten is a complex right, and there is still some uncertainty about how it will be interpreted and applied in practice. However, it is clear that the GDPR gives individuals a significant new right to control their personal data.",Negate
8,"Under GDPR, parental consent is always required when collecting personal data from children","Yes, that is correct. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), parental consent is always required when collecting personal data from children under the age of 16. This is because children are considered to be more vulnerable to the risks of data processing, and they may not be able to fully understand the implications of consenting to the processing of their personal data.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, parental consent is not required if the processing of the child's personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the child is party, or if the processing is necessary for the protection of the vital interests of the child. However, in all cases, the controller must take reasonable steps to verify that the child is over the age of 16 or that parental consent has been given.

The GDPR is a complex piece of legislation, and there are many nuances to the rules on parental consent. If you are unsure whether you need parental consent to collect personal data from a child, it is always best to err on the side of caution and seek legal advice.",Support
9,"Under GDPR, every business will be subject to new data portability rules","Yes, that is true. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that outlines the rights of individuals with respect to their personal data and the obligations of organizations that process personal data. One of the key provisions of the GDPR is the right to data portability, which gives individuals the right to receive the personal data they have provided to an organization in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. They also have the right to request that the organization transmit this data directly to another organization.

The right to data portability applies to all organizations that process personal data of individuals located in the EU, regardless of whether the organization is located in the EU. This means that every business that processes personal data of EU citizens will be subject to the new data portability rules under the GDPR.

The right to data portability is intended to give individuals more control over their personal data and to make it easier for them to switch between service providers. It is also intended to promote competition in the digital economy by making it easier for businesses to compete with each other on the basis of the quality of their services, rather than on the basis of their ability to collect and store large amounts of personal data about their users.

The GDPR has been in effect since May 25, 2018. Organizations that have not yet complied with the GDPR's data portability requirements should do so as soon as possible.",Support
10,"Under GDPR, profiling activities always require consent","The claim that ""Under GDPR, profiling activities always require consent"" is not entirely true. GDPR does require consent for profiling in some cases, but there are other lawful grounds for profiling as well.

Article 6 of the GDPR sets out the lawful grounds for processing personal data. One of these lawful grounds is consent. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. It must also be given for a specific purpose.

Profiling is the automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, such as their performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.

If you are profiling someone's personal data, you will need to have a lawful ground for doing so. If you are profiling someone's personal data for the purpose of making a decision about them that has a significant impact on them, you will need to have their consent. However, if you are profiling someone's personal data for other purposes, such as marketing or fraud prevention, you may be able to rely on another lawful ground, such as legitimate interests.

If you are unsure whether you need consent for profiling, you should seek legal advice.",Negate
11,Pseudonymised data (eg hashed data) are treated exactly like any other personal data under the GDPR,"The claim that pseudonymised data (e.g. hashed data) are treated exactly like any other personal data under the GDPR is not entirely true. While pseudonymised data is still considered personal data under the GDPR, it does offer some advantages over non-pseudonymised data. For example, pseudonymised data can be shared more easily without compromising the privacy of individuals. Additionally, pseudonymised data can be used for research and other purposes without the need for consent from individuals.

However, it is important to note that pseudonymised data can still be re-identified, and therefore it is important to take steps to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is pseudonymised. For example, organizations should use strong encryption and other security measures to protect pseudonymised data. Additionally, organizations should have clear policies in place for how pseudonymised data is to be used and shared.

Overall, pseudonymisation is a valuable tool for protecting the privacy of individuals while still allowing organizations to share and use data. However, it is important to take steps to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is pseudonymised.

Here are some additional details about the GDPR's requirements for pseudonymised data:

Pseudonymised data must be processed in a way that does not allow individuals to be identified.
Organizations must take steps to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is pseudonymised.
Organizations must have clear policies in place for how pseudonymised data is to be used and shared.
If you have any questions about the GDPR's requirements for pseudonymised data, please contact your organization's data protection officer.",Negate
12,The GDPR will reduce paperwork for organisations as the notification requirement will be scrapped,"No, it is not true. The GDPR does not scrap the notification requirement for data breaches. In fact, it strengthens it. Under the GDPR, organizations are required to report data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of them. This is in contrast to the previous Data Protection Directive, which did not have a specific deadline for reporting data breaches.

The GDPR's notification requirement is designed to help protect individuals whose data has been compromised. By requiring organizations to report data breaches quickly, the GDPR helps to ensure that individuals can take steps to mitigate the risks associated with their data being exposed.

The GDPR's notification requirement may add some paperwork for organizations, but it is an important step in protecting the privacy of individuals.",Negate
13,"Since my organisation is compliant under the Directive, there will not be too much work involved in becoming GDPR compliant","The claim that an organization that is compliant with the Data Protection Directive (Directive) is already compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is not entirely true. While there is a lot of overlap between the two regulations, there are also some key differences.

For example, the GDPR introduces a number of new rights for individuals, such as the right to be forgotten and the right to data portability. It also increases the fines for non-compliance. As a result, organizations that are already compliant with the Directive may need to make some changes in order to fully comply with the GDPR.

The amount of work involved in becoming GDPR compliant will vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization, as well as the nature of the data it collects and processes. However, it is important to note that the GDPR is a complex regulation, and organizations should not underestimate the amount of work involved in becoming compliant.

Here are some tips for organizations that are already compliant with the Directive but need to become GDPR compliant:

19,Self-driving cars are controlled by classical computer algorithms (if-then rules),"No, that claim is not true. Self-driving cars are controlled by a combination of classical computer algorithms and machine learning algorithms. Classical computer algorithms are used to process sensor data and make basic decisions about the car's surroundings, such as identifying objects and tracking their movements. Machine learning algorithms are used to learn from data and make more complex decisions, such as predicting the behavior of other drivers and planning the car's route.

The use of machine learning is essential for self-driving cars to be able to handle the complex and unpredictable nature of driving. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to recognize different types of road signs, even if they are obscured or damaged. It can also be trained to predict the behavior of other drivers, even if they are making unexpected or dangerous moves.

Classical computer algorithms are still necessary for self-driving cars, but they are not sufficient. Machine learning algorithms are essential for self-driving cars to be able to learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment.",Negate
23,Self-driving cars will increase congestion in cities,"Whether self-driving cars will increase congestion in cities is a complex question with no easy answer. There are a number of factors that could contribute to either increased or decreased congestion, and the overall impact is likely to vary depending on the specific city and its transportation infrastructure.

Some experts believe that self-driving cars could actually help to reduce congestion. For example, self-driving cars could be programmed to drive more efficiently, such as by maintaining a consistent speed and distance from other vehicles. They could also communicate with each other to coordinate their movements, which could further improve traffic flow. In addition, self-driving cars could potentially be used to provide ride-hailing or taxi services, which could reduce the number of personal vehicles on the road.

However, other experts believe that self-driving cars could actually increase congestion. For example, if people are no longer required to drive themselves, they may be more likely to make trips that they would not otherwise make. This could lead to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, which could contribute to congestion. In addition, if self-driving cars are owned by fleets rather than individuals, they may be more likely to be used for short trips, which could also contribute to congestion.

Ultimately, the impact of self-driving cars on congestion is likely to be a complex mix of both positive and negative effects. The overall impact will depend on a number of factors, including the specific design of the self-driving cars, the way in which they are used, and the overall transportation infrastructure of the city.",Noncommittal

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It is made up of blocks of data that are linked together using cryptography. Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This is because each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block. If any data in a block is changed, the hash will be different and the block will not be accepted by the network.

This immutability is one of the key features of blockchain that makes it so secure. It means that once data is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with or deleted. This makes blockchain ideal for applications where security and transparency are essential, such as financial transactions, supply chain management, and voting.

However, it is important to note that blockchain is not completely immutable. There are some cases where data can be changed on the blockchain, such as when a bug is found in the code or when a transaction needs to be reversed. In these cases, a new block is created that contains the changes to the data. The old block is then marked as invalid and is no longer considered part of the chain.

Overall, blockchain is a very secure and tamper-proof technology. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of immutability.",Support

However, even with these features, blockchain does not eliminate the need for trust entirely. For example, users still need to trust that the nodes on the network are not malicious and that they will not attempt to tamper with the data. Additionally, users still need to trust the software that is used to create and maintain the blockchain.

Overall, blockchain can help to reduce the need for trust, but it does not eliminate it entirely. Users still need to exercise some degree of caution when using blockchain-based systems.

Here are some additional points to consider:

* Blockchain can help to reduce the need for trust between parties, but it does not eliminate it entirely.
* Blockchain is a secure system, but it is not infallible.
* Users still need to exercise some degree of caution when using blockchain-based systems.",Negate
63,Any participant (anywhere in the world) can validate any blockchain transaction on a public blockchain.,"Yes, that is true. In a public blockchain, anyone can participate in the validation of transactions. This is one of the key features of blockchain technology that makes it so secure and transparent.

When a transaction is made on a public blockchain, it is broadcast to all nodes on the network. Each node then validates the transaction by checking that it is valid according to the blockchain's rules. If the transaction is valid, it is added to the blockchain and becomes a permanent part of the ledger.

Anyone can participate in the validation of transactions by running a full node. A full node is a computer that has a copy of the entire blockchain. This allows full nodes to verify all transactions on the blockchain and ensure that they are valid.

The ability for anyone to validate transactions is one of the key features that makes public blockchains so secure. By allowing anyone to participate in the validation process, it becomes very difficult to tamper with the blockchain or to make fraudulent transactions.

Here are some of the benefits of allowing anyone to validate blockchain transactions:

* Increased security: The more people who are validating transactions, the more difficult it is to tamper with the blockchain.
* Transparency: Everyone can see all of the transactions that are taking place on the blockchain, which makes it very difficult to hide fraudulent activity.
* Decentralization: No single entity controls the blockchain, which makes it very difficult to censor or control.

Overall, allowing anyone to validate blockchain transactions is a key feature that makes public blockchains so secure, transparent, and decentralized.",Support
64,"The blockchain ecosystems are necessarily free of any intermediation (brokers, curators).","The claim that ""blockchain ecosystems are necessarily free of any intermediation"" is not entirely true. While blockchain technology does have the potential to reduce the need for intermediaries, it is not a silver bullet. There are still a number of situations where intermediaries will be necessary, such as when providing identity verification or dispute resolution services.

In addition, even in cases where intermediaries are not strictly necessary, they may still play a valuable role in facilitating transactions and providing other services. For example, exchanges and wallets can provide valuable services to users of cryptocurrencies, even though these services could theoretically be provided by the blockchain itself.

Ultimately, the extent to which blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries will depend on a number of factors, including the specific application and the needs of the users. However, it is clear that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly reduce the need for intermediaries in a wide range of industries.

Here are some examples of how blockchain technology can reduce the need for intermediaries:

* **Financial services:** Blockchain technology can be used to create decentralized exchanges that allow users to trade assets directly with each other, without the need for a third-party broker.
* **Supply chain management:** Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and transparent record of the provenance of goods, which can help to reduce fraud and improve efficiency.
* **Healthcare:** Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and private record of patient medical data, which can help to improve patient care and reduce costs.

These are just a few examples of how blockchain technology can reduce the need for intermediaries. As the technology continues to develop, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications that further reduce the need for third-party involvement.",Negate
65,Adoption of cryptocurrencies in place of fiat currencies would eliminate hyperinflation plaguing countries like Venezuela.,"It is not clear whether the adoption of cryptocurrencies in place of fiat currencies would eliminate hyperinflation plaguing countries like Venezuela. There are some potential benefits to using cryptocurrencies in these countries, such as their decentralized nature and their resistance to inflation. However, there are also some potential drawbacks, such as their volatility and their lack of regulation.

One potential benefit of using cryptocurrencies in countries with hyperinflation is that they could provide a more stable store of value than fiat currencies. This is because cryptocurrencies are not subject to the same government policies that can lead to hyperinflation. For example, in Venezuela, the government has been printing money at an alarming rate, which has led to the value of the Venezuelan bolivar plummeting. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are not subject to this kind of government interference.

Another potential benefit of using cryptocurrencies in countries with hyperinflation is that they could make it easier for people to conduct international transactions. This is because cryptocurrencies are not subject to the same capital controls that can be imposed by governments. For example, in Venezuela, the government has imposed strict capital controls, which have made it difficult for people to move money out of the country. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are not subject to these controls.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cryptocurrencies in countries with hyperinflation. One drawback is that cryptocurrencies are very volatile. This means that their prices can fluctuate wildly, which can make it difficult to use them as a store of value. For example, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent years, making it a risky investment.

Another drawback of using cryptocurrencies in countries with hyperinflation is that they are not regulated. This means that there is no government oversight of cryptocurrencies, which can make them a target for fraud and scams. For example, there have been a number of high-profile scams involving cryptocurrencies in recent years.

Overall, it is not clear whether the adoption of cryptocurrencies in place of fiat currencies would eliminate hyperinflation plaguing countries like Venezuela. There are some potential benefits to using cryptocurrencies in these countries, but there are also some potential drawbacks. More research is needed to determine whether the benefits of using cryptocurrencies outweigh the drawbacks.",Negate
66,Public blockchains are completely decentralized.,"Public blockchains are not completely decentralized. While they are not controlled by any single entity, they are still subject to the control of the majority of nodes on the network. This means that if a group of nodes were to collude, they could potentially control the network and censor transactions or data. Additionally, public blockchains are often secured by proof-of-work or proof-of-stake mechanisms, which require a significant amount of computing power or cryptocurrency to participate. This can make it difficult for individuals or small groups to participate in the network and influence its governance.

Despite these limitations, public blockchains offer a number of advantages over centralized systems. They are more secure, transparent, and auditable. They are also more resistant to censorship and fraud. As a result, public blockchains are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of applications, including cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and voting.

Here are some of the benefits of public blockchains:

* **Security:** Public blockchains are secured by cryptography, which makes them very difficult to hack.
* **Transparency:** All transactions on a public blockchain are public, which makes it easy to track and audit them.
* **Auditability:** Public blockchains are auditable, which means that anyone can verify the integrity of the data.
* **Resilience to censorship:** Public blockchains are resistant to censorship because they are not controlled by any single entity.
* **Immutability:** Once data is added to a public blockchain, it cannot be changed.

Here are some of the limitations of public blockchains:

* **Slow transaction speeds:** Public blockchains can be slow to process transactions, especially when they are congested.
* **High energy consumption:** Public blockchains that use proof-of-work consensus mechanisms consume a lot of energy.
* **High entry barrier:** Public blockchains can be expensive to join, as they require users to purchase cryptocurrency or computing power.
* **Security risks:** Public blockchains are still vulnerable to security risks, such as hacking and fraud.

Overall, public blockchains offer a number of advantages over centralized systems. However, they also have some limitations that need to be considered before using them.",Negate
67,Public blockchains are more secure than private blockchains.,"Yes, public blockchains are generally more secure than private blockchains. This is because public blockchains are decentralized, meaning that there is no single point of control. This makes it more difficult for attackers to target the network. Additionally, public blockchains use cryptography to secure their data, which makes it very difficult to hack.

Private blockchains, on the other hand, are centralized, meaning that there is a single entity that controls the network. This makes it easier for attackers to target the network. Additionally, private blockchains often use less robust security measures than public blockchains.

However, it is important to note that no blockchain is completely secure. Even public blockchains have been hacked in the past. However, the decentralized nature of public blockchains makes them more resilient to attack than private blockchains.

Here is a table that summarizes the security differences between public and private blockchains:

| Feature | Public Blockchain | Private Blockchain |
|---|---|---|
| Decentralization | Yes | No |
| Security | More secure | Less secure |
| Cryptography | More robust | Less robust |
| Resilience to attack | More resilient | Less resilient |

68,Off-chain sensitive data storage in a traditional database system is better than on-chain storage of data in the blockchain system.,"Off-chain sensitive data storage in a traditional database system can be better than on-chain storage of data in the blockchain system in some cases. Here are some of the reasons why:

* **Privacy:** Sensitive data can be stored more securely off-chain, as it is not publicly accessible on the blockchain.
* **Performance:** Off-chain storage can improve performance, as it can be accessed more quickly than data stored on the blockchain.
* **Cost:** Off-chain storage can be more cost-effective, as it can be stored in a more efficient manner than data stored on the blockchain.

However, there are also some disadvantages to off-chain storage:

* **Security:** Off-chain storage can be more vulnerable to attack, as it is not as decentralized as data stored on the blockchain.
* **Scalability:** Off-chain storage can be less scalable than data stored on the blockchain, as it can be more difficult to add more storage capacity.
* **Compliance:** Off-chain storage can be more difficult to comply with regulations, as it is not as transparent as data stored on the blockchain.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use off-chain or on-chain storage depends on the specific needs of the application. If privacy and performance are more important than security and scalability, then off-chain storage may be a better option. However, if security and scalability are more important than privacy and performance, then on-chain storage may be a better option.

Here are some additional considerations that may affect the decision of whether to use off-chain or on-chain storage:

* **The type of data being stored:** Some types of data are more sensitive than others, and may require more secure storage.

78,"Even if messages are end-to-end encrypted, they can also be read by third parties during transmission.","In general, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a very secure way to communicate. It prevents anyone who is not the sender or recipient from reading the message, even if they have access to the network that the message is traveling over. However, there are some cases where E2EE messages can be read by third parties.

One way this can happen is if the message is intercepted in transit. This can happen if the message is sent over an insecure network, such as a public Wi-Fi network. If an attacker is able to intercept the message, they can decrypt it using the encryption keys that are stored on the sender's and recipient's devices.

Another way that E2EE messages can be read by third parties is if the encryption keys are compromised. This can happen if the keys are stolen or if the devices that store the keys are hacked. If the encryption keys are compromised, anyone who has access to them can decrypt any messages that have been sent using those keys.

Finally, it is important to note that E2EE does not protect against all forms of attack. For example, if the sender or recipient is coerced into revealing the encryption keys, the message can be decrypted. Additionally, E2EE does not protect against messages that are intercepted and stored before they are sent.

Overall, E2EE is a very secure way to communicate, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks. If you are concerned about your privacy, you should take steps to protect your encryption keys and to use a secure network.

84,"Even while a user was logged into a Google account, their search queries would not be saved while in private mode because private mode does not save search histories.","Yes, that claim is true. When you use private mode in Google Chrome, your search queries are not saved to your browser history or to your Google account. This means that other people who use your device will not be able to see what you have searched for, and Google will not be able to track your search history for advertising purposes.

However, it is important to note that private mode does not protect you from all forms of tracking. For example, websites can still track your activity using cookies and other tracking technologies. Additionally, your internet service provider (ISP) can still see what websites you visit, even if you are using private mode.

If you are concerned about your privacy, you can take additional steps to protect yourself, such as using a VPN or a private search engine.",Support
85,"Bookmarks saved in private mode would not persist in later sessions because private mode deletes all local, temporary data, including bookmarks.","Yes, that is true. Bookmarks saved in private mode would not persist in later sessions because private mode deletes all local, temporary data, including bookmarks. Private mode is a feature in web browsers that allows users to browse the internet without their activity being saved. This means that no history, cookies, or other data will be saved from the session. This can be useful for users who want to keep their browsing activity private or who want to test a website without affecting their regular browsing experience.

When you save a bookmark in private mode, it is not saved to your browser's bookmarks file. Instead, it is saved to a temporary file that is deleted when you close the private browsing window. This means that the bookmark will not be available in later sessions.

If you want to save a bookmark for future use, you should save it in regular browsing mode. This will ensure that the bookmark is saved to your browser's bookmarks file and will be available in later sessions.

Here are some additional details about how private mode works:

* Private mode does not save your browsing history. This means that websites you visit will not be added to your history list.
* Private mode does not save cookies. Cookies are small files that websites save on your computer. They can be used to track your browsing activity or to remember your preferences.
* Private mode does not save temporary files. Temporary files are files that websites create when you visit them. They can be used to store data such as images or videos.
* Private mode does not affect your saved passwords or other saved information. This information is stored in a different location and is not affected by private mode.

If you are concerned about your privacy, you can use private mode when browsing the internet. However, it is important to note that private mode does not offer complete privacy. Websites can still track your activity in other ways, such as by using your IP address.",Support
86,Government would need a warrant to access browsing activity from private mode.,"Yes, the government would need a warrant to access browsing activity from private mode. Private mode is a feature of web browsers that allows users to browse the web without their browsing history being saved. However, this does not mean that the government cannot access browsing activity from private mode. The government can obtain a warrant to access browsing activity from private mode if they have probable cause to believe that the activity is related to a crime.

In the United States, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that the government cannot search your home or belongings without a warrant. However, there are exceptions to this rule, one of which is if the government has probable cause to believe that you are involved in criminal activity.

If the government believes that you are using private mode to engage in criminal activity, they can obtain a warrant to access your browsing activity. A warrant is a court order that allows the government to search your property or belongings. To obtain a warrant, the government must show probable cause to the judge. Probable cause means that the government has a reasonable belief that you are involved in criminal activity.

If the government obtains a warrant to access your browsing activity, they can see all of the websites that you have visited, as well as the dates and times that you visited them. They can also see the search terms that you have used.

If you are concerned about the government accessing your browsing activity, you can take steps to protect your privacy. One way to do this is to use a VPN (virtual private network). A VPN encrypts your traffic, making it difficult for the government to track your online activity. You can also use a private browser, such as Tor. Tor is a free and open-source browser that routes your traffic through a series of servers, making it difficult for anyone to track your online activity.",Support
87,Employers would be unable to track employees when they used private mode.,"The claim that employers would be unable to track employees when they used private mode is not entirely true.

There are a few potential inconveniences associated with two-factor authentication. First, it can be slow and frustrating to have to enter a code from your phone every time you log in. Second, if you lose your phone or it is stolen, you may be locked out of your accounts until you can get a new one. Third, some people find it difficult to remember two different passwords, especially if they use different passwords for different accounts.

However, there are also a number of security benefits to using two-factor authentication. First, it makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your accounts, even if they have your password. Second, it can help to prevent account takeovers, which are a common way for hackers to steal personal information. Third, it can help to protect your accounts from phishing attacks, which are emails that try to trick you into revealing your personal information.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use two-factor authentication is a personal one. If you are concerned about the security of your accounts, then the extra step of authentication is probably worth it. However, if you find the inconvenience to be too great, then you may want to consider other security measures, such as using strong passwords and being careful about what information you share online.

Here are some additional thoughts on the pros and cons of two-factor authentication:

**Pros:**

* Increased security
* Reduced risk of account takeovers
* Protection from phishing attacks

**Cons:**

* Inconvenience
* Potential for lost or stolen phones
* Difficulty remembering two passwords

Overall, two-factor authentication is a valuable security tool that can help to protect your accounts from hackers. However, it is important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not to use it.",Noncommittal
130,Cookies can be used to transmit viruses,"It is not possible for cookies to transmit viruses or malware to your computer under normal circumstances. Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer to track your browsing activity. They are not executable files, so they cannot run on your computer and infect it with malware.

However, there is a possibility that a malicious website could trick you into installing malware by disguising it as a cookie. This is why it is important to be careful about what websites you visit and what files you download. If you are ever unsure about a website, you can always use a security scanner to check it for malware before visiting it.

Here are some tips to help you stay safe from malware:

* Keep your operating system and software up to date.
* Use a firewall and antivirus software.
* Be careful about what websites you visit and what files you download.
* Do not open emails from unknown senders.
* Do not click on links in emails from unknown senders.
* Be careful about what information you share online.

By following these tips, you can help protect yourself from malware and other online threats.",Negate
131,"Smart locks pose a security risk if because if I have my phone and am close to my door inside my home, my door will unlock","Yes, that is true. Smart locks that use Bluetooth to unlock the door can pose a security risk if you have your phone with you and are close to your door inside your home. This is because a hacker could potentially intercept the Bluetooth signal between your phone and the lock, and then use that signal to unlock the door without your permission.

There are a few things you can do to mitigate this risk:

* Use a smart lock that supports two-factor authentication. This will require you to enter a code from your phone in addition to using Bluetooth to unlock the door.
* Keep your phone's Bluetooth turned off when you are not using it. This will make it more difficult for hackers to intercept the Bluetooth signal.
* Make sure your smart lock is up to date with the latest firmware. This will help to protect your lock from known security vulnerabilities.

It is important to note that smart locks are still a relatively new technology, and there are always risks associated with using any new technology. However, by taking the steps outlined above, you can help to mitigate the security risks associated with using a smart lock.

Here are some additional tips for keeping your smart lock secure:

* Use strong passwords and PINs.
* Do not share your passwords or PINs with anyone.
* Change your passwords and PINs regularly.
* Keep your smart lock firmware up to date.
* Do not install any unauthorized apps on your phone.
* Be careful about what information you share about your smart lock on social media.
* Monitor your smart lock for suspicious activity.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your smart lock secure and protect your home from unauthorized entry.",Support
132,All IoT Devices store all their data in remote servers in a specific loaction,"No, it is not true that all IoT devices store all their data in remote servers in a specific location. There are a variety of ways that IoT devices can store data, including:

* **Remote servers:** This is the most common way to store IoT data. Remote servers are typically located in data centers, which are secure facilities that are designed to protect data from unauthorized access.
* **Local servers:** Some IoT devices store data on local servers. This is often done for devices that need to access data quickly, such as devices that are used for real-time monitoring or control.
* **Edge devices:** Edge devices are small, powerful computers that are located near IoT devices. Edge devices can be used to store data locally, which can help to improve performance and reduce latency.
* **The cloud:** The cloud is a network of remote servers that can be used to store data. The cloud is a popular option for IoT data storage because it offers a variety of benefits, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

The best way to store IoT data depends on the specific needs of the application. For example, if the application requires real-time access to data, then local storage may be the best option. If the application requires a large amount of data to be stored, then cloud storage may be the best option.

It is important to note that there are some security risks associated with storing IoT data in remote servers. These risks can be mitigated by using strong security measures, such as encryption and authentication.",Negate
133,Biometrics in FIDO2 Biometric WebAuthn is stored on the server or in a remote database operated by the website,"No, that claim is not true. Biometrics in FIDO2 Biometric WebAuthn is not stored on the server or in a remote database operated by the website. Instead, biometric data is stored locally on the user's device, such as a smartphone or laptop. This means that biometric data is not accessible to the website or any other third party.

FIDO2 Biometric WebAuthn is a security protocol that uses biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to authenticate users. This protocol is designed to be more secure than traditional password-based authentication, as it is much more difficult to steal or hack biometric data.

When a user signs in to a website using FIDO2 Biometric WebAuthn, their device generates a unique cryptographic keypair. The private key is stored locally on the device, while the public key is sent to the website. The website then uses the public key to verify the user's identity.

If the user's fingerprint or facial recognition is successfully verified, the website will allow the user to sign in. However, if the biometric data is not successfully verified, the user will be prompted to try again.

FIDO2 Biometric WebAuthn is a secure and convenient way to authenticate users. It is a more secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication, and it is also more convenient, as users do not have to remember passwords.",Negate
